# Goal:
After completing this scenario, users will be able to install additional
software into a container image.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Downloading a Red Hat Universal Base Image (UBI)
* Positioning or configuring a container to use 3rd party repositories
* Install 3rd party software into the container image
* Commit changes to create a new container image
* Validate the containerized application

# Example Usecase:
You have a piece of software that you would like to deploy within a container
image rather than installing it natively on the host system.  By using a
container image, you can copy the entire environment for the software to
several different hosts or run multiple copies of it on the same system.
