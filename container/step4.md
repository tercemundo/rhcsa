# Committing the new container image

At this point, the container is configured.  It is time to transition from a
working container into a committed image.  In the command below, you will use
the `buildah` command to commit the working container to an image called:
`moon-buggy`.

`buildah commit ubi-working-container moon-buggy`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">

The above output shows that the commit was successful, however you can verify
this by looking at the available container images on the system.

`podman image list`{{execute T1}}

<pre class="file">

Notice in the output above that `moon-buggy` is the first container image
listed in the `podman image list` output.
