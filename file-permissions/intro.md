# Overview:

It is common for multiple users to potentially have access to the same files.
This means that understanding file permissions is a foundational skill for
any system administrator. This lab is designed to provide you with a basic
understanding of how to control who has access to various files on a system. 

# Goal:

After completing this scenario, users will be able to read, understand, and
change permissions of files and directories on their system.

# Concepts included in this scenario:
* Learn how to view permissions with `ls -l`
* Explore how changing user accounts impacts interacting with files
* Use `chmod` to change file permissions
* Test out `chown` with example user accounts and groups
* Learn how to use `find` to filter files based on their permissions
